# Odin-Sign-up-Form

## Overview

Odin-Sign-up-Form is a project created as part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course. It's a sign-up form implemented using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. We were provided with an [example form](sign-up-form-example.png) for inspiration and as a layout to follow. The project showcases various features including the use of an external font via `@font-face`, an SVG graphic created in Inkscape, flexbox for layout, and error handling for cases where passwords do not match.

## Features

- Utilizes an external font (`@font-face`) for enhanced typography.
- Incorporates an SVG graphic created in Inkscape to enhance visual appeal.
- Implements flexbox for flexible and responsive layout design.
- Provides error messages when passwords do not match to improve user experience.
- Uses the `:focus` and `valid` pseudo-classes for styling input fields.
